When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think we have two answers for this question. The first and most common one is when you are working with a team and everyone is contributing in the project. 

The second, and in my opinion a very critical one, is for have a backup of all your work. Imagining you are working in a very huge project and suddenly your computer dies. If you don't have a backup you'll be in a very hard place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if you are working with a team, sometimes there are some new updates available on the remote repository that will cause conflicts with your current code. So it's wise to check the changes made on the remote repository before push.
