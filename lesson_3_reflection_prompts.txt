When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think we have two answers for this question. The first and most common one is when you are working with a team and everyone is contributing in the project. 

The second, and in my opinion a very critical one, is for have a backup of all your work. Imagining you are working in a very huge project and suddenly your computer dies. If you don't have a backup you'll be in a very hard place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if you are working with a team, sometimes there are some new updates available on the remote repository that will cause conflicts with your current code. So it's wise to check the changes made on the remote repository before push.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used only on GitHub. It will copy a enterely repository to you own account. But the owner of the original repository will know that you have copied it. All the changes made on the copied repository will not affect the original one.

Clone is when you copy a repository directly to your computer. In that mode, the owner will not know that his repository was copied by someone. All the changes made on the copied repository will not affect the original one.

Branches is made on your own repository to create separated path from your master branch. The branch will allow you to work, for instance, in a new version of your code, without impact the code in production.

Fork is used on the GitHub website.

Clone is used to get your own created online repository to your computer.

Branch is used either on you computer or on the GitHub website to create a separated version of your master branch.
